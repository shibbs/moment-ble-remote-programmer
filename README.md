# moment-ble-remote-programmer
Program for uploading firmware and verifying the radio from a Raspi to the Moment Bluetooth trigger remotes

This needs to run on a Raspberry Pi V3
The repo needs to sit at /home/pi/moment-ble

This repository is designed to be pulled into the default level of a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B V1.2 that has already been set up with the correct version of raspbian. I don't think there is anything too fancy that is needed for the Upload repos, but I do recall there being some annoying BLE setup for the scanner application. To keep things simple, this repo should be pulled from a raspi that already has the correct image running. That image is stored on Steve's computer
